1. I have used "npx create-react-app" command for installing all packages and dependencies but it was old version and my system want to have latest release (5.1.0). So, I have used the command "npx create-react-app@latest".
2. I have named the file "devTask" while creating the file but it violates the npm naming convention and has caused restrictions which says "name can no longer contain capital letters". So, I changed the name to "devtask".
3. Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'src/component/Landing.js' in 'C:\Users\shilp\Desktop\devTask\devtask\src'
4. To create a production build use command npm run build.
5. To move from one page to another without reloading the page, I used React Router.
6. Input tag is a self closing tag
7. Imported BrowserTag but never used
8. Faced "Cannot read properties of null" error because react and react-router-dom version mismatch. So I downgrade React to 18 as it was stable and well tested. For this, used the command : npm install react@18 react-dom@18
9. I have used fieldset and legend to make the name over the field name
10. The css style of landing page working globally and affecting the login page. To resolve this, change the login page className as they had same class names.
